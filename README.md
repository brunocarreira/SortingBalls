# SortingBalls
In the Pragmatic Lottery (motto: There’s One Born Every Minute, and it Might Just Be You!), we select each week’s winning combination by drawing balls. There are sixty balls, numbered (not surprisingly, as we are programmers) 0 to 59. The balls are drawn by the personable, but somewhat distracted, Daisy Mae. As a result, some weeks five numbers are drawn, while other weeks seven, nine, or even fifteen balls make it to the winner’s rack.
